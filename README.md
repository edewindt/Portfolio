# My Personal Website/ Portfolio

## Intro

I like making things that I'm proud of, that I'm passionate about, and what better place to do that then with my personal website. This site should reflect who I am as a person. I'm someone who tries to defy expectations, who attemps to go above and beyond. I also take inspiration from many different places. I do almost everything that I do because I enjoy doing it. I would program for fun, infact programming has repalced video games and TV for me. On my free time I spend most of my time either reading documentation, or coding my own games, or some other project. Deep down though you could argue that I'm just an artist. I think programming is a just a subset of art, that no one seems to understand.

## Description

The UI may change overtime, but I want it to be interactive. Animations, 3D graphics or perhaps video games may be included in the UI. I will include all of the important elements that a personal website should include. Such as my projects, a bio perhaps, any relevant experience that I have, which at the time of me making this, is virtually none. I hope to change that soon though.

## Open Source

I've decided to make this open source, anyone can see the source code, and how I did it, I can even make a tutorial on how I did what I did if anyone is interested in that. I will be using Svelte, since it is by far my favorite way to work with JavaScript. There were many ways I couldve done this. If I wanted to be really flexible I could have used the react and vue cdn's and then compiled the svelte code to vanilla JS to use directly. If I had I done this, then I couldve used all 3 frameworks in this project. However, I just wanted to have fun and be creative and not worry too much about the complexity. There will plenty of complexity in what I implement into this project theres no need to add further abstractions that would only slow me down.

## Conclusion

If you've visited the site, I hope you thought it was cool. My goal was to make something special, I hope I succeeded.
